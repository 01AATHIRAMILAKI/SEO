Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are ideal for situations where a fixed infrastructure is unavailable or infeasible. Today’s MANETs, however, may suffer from network partitioning. This limitation makes MANETs unsuitable for applications such as crisis management and battlefield communications, in which team members might need to work in groups scattered in the application terrain. In such applications, intergroup communication is crucial to the team collaboration. To address this weakness, we introduce in this paper a new class of ad-hoc network called Autonomous Mobile Mesh Network (AMMNET). Unlike conventional mesh networks, the mobile mesh nodes of an AMMNET are capable of following the mesh clients in the application terrain, and organizing themselves into a suitable network topology to ensure good connectivity for both intra- and intergroup communicationsIn a standard wireless mesh network, stationary mesh nodes provide routing and relay capabilities. They form a mesh-like wireless network that allows mobile mesh clients to communicate with each other through multihop communications. Such a network is scalable, flexible, and low in maintenance cost. When a mesh node fails, it can simply be replaced by a new one; and the mesh network will recognize the new mesh node and automatically reconfigure itself.
